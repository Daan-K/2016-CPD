# Projects

Besides a presentation, you should perform a small experimental
research project.

### Procedure
1. Choose a problem to work. 
1. Submit your research proposal to me, no later than noon 2/12.
1. Discuss & research this topic.
1. Submit a report. See below.

#### Research proposal

The aim of this project is to perform an experimental study of the
language you have chosen. In your proposal, please use the following
format:

1. Background -- what language will you be using? Provide some
   background about what sets this language apart from other
   programming languages.
   
1. Problem -- what experiment do you wish to perform? Typically, you
   should think of studying how concepts or ideas from one language
   can be transported to your language of choice: 
   * how can we embed a domain specific languages for X in language Y?
   * Or how does language Z handle support metaprogramming/concurrency/...?
   
1. Methodology -- provide a detailed description of what it is that
   you would like to write. What are your expected outcomes? What
   contingency plans can you make if things do not work out?
   
1. Planning -- how can will you translate the steps you identified in
   the previous section to a concrete planning? Who will work on what?

### Project report 

Besides these issues, the final report should also document your
results. What have you achieved? What worked well? What was hard? How
might these issues be resolved? What language extensions would have
made your life easier? How do other languages solve these issues? What
other attempts have been made to address your problem?

Depending on interest, I'd like to offer students the opportunity to
present and learn from one another's work (the exact format is still
to be decided).

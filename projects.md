# Projects

Besides a presentation, you should perform a small research project.

### Procedure
1. Choose a problem to work. 
1. Submit your research proposal to me.
1. Discuss & research this topic.
1. Present your results. We will hold a workshop during the exam time for every team to present.
1. Submit a report. See below.

### Criteria
The main focus of the project report and presentation should be the following:

* Research question. Identify a clear and motivated question to answer.
* Research contribution. Develop an implementation or new knowledge to answer the research question.
* Research method. Discuss how you arrived at your answer.
* Related work. Compare your answer with other contributions.

Of course, there is only limited time to work on your research. We expect a brief report, of just a couple of pages (in principle no more than 10 pages), and a short presentation (around 10 - 15 minutes).
